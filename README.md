# Discord Bot

Just a simple bot to help me and my girlfriend share music a little more passively since we both struggle with switching tasks/remembering things.

Thought this was a cool project and worth expanding on :)

# Spotipy

Largely, the code is handled within Spotify.py which largely leans on the [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/) library.

This library is great but can be a bit cumbersome to work with at first.

# Discord Bot API

The [Discord Bot API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) is well documented and was also used, but is the simpler component of this particular project.

# Commands

!rec <song name> - This command will add a song to the spotify playlist

* !yt <youtube mobile link> - This command will add a video to the youtube queue
* !getyt - This command will create a link to the YouTube queue.
* !clearQ - This will clear the youtube q and make a backup incase anything cool was in there that the other person wanted.
