# Discord Bot

Just a simple bot to help me and my girlfriend share music a little more passively since we both struggle with switching tasks/remembering things.

Thought this was a cool project and worth expanding on :)

# Spotipy

Largely, the code is handled within Spotify.py which largely leans on the [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/) library.

This library is great but can be a bit cumbersome to work with at first.

# Discord Bot API

The [Discord Bot API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) is well documented and was also used, but is the simpler component of this particular project.
